# Overview

This project is an absolvent project for the Data academy course - Power BI part. 

This report provides an overview of one yearâ€™s worth of fictitious sales and purchase data for a fuel card company.

The structure of the data is inspired by a real company of this type, but the data itself was created solely for the purposes of this project.

The data presents totals for sales and purchases by period (month), fuel station, product, vendor, and customer.
